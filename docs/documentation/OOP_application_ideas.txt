OOP application idea's:
 - total CO2 score visible at the end of the day
 - scoreboard with all the users their score for comparison
 - recieve a 'tree' when you improve your score by x points (in relation to the average dutch CO2 footprint, perhaps)
 - Net Beans for the GUI
	> GUI has a mockup
	> green color for the application
	> drop down menu's, interlinked to let the first show food/energy/transport, the second shows e.g. 'eat vegetarian meal'
 - the application uses a Web API and a (Mongo) DB
 - no Android app will be made
 - the application is not a web application, but a desktop application (connected to the internet)
 - secure implementation, https-usage, password system
 - three graphs per person that will constitute the final score
